###Challenge 5 - PyBer Rideshare Analysis
In this week's challenge the client asks for analysis of data on rideshare usage and rates. In order to deliver a concise and coherent analysis, my partner Omar and I used Python's matplotlib and pandas functionalities to compile the data. Let's take a look.

##Analysis - Location
Unsurprisingly, the majority of rideshare fares are hailed in urban environments, and urban rides account for almost double the total fares of rural and suburban rides combined. That said, there is a steep decline in profitability for drivers in urban environments, as they are travelling far less distance.

If I may make a suggestion, it appears that the suburban rides are generally more profitable, albeit fewer in number. If PyBer were in the business of retaining a fleet of drivers (assuming the current model is not conducive to employing drivers, therefore capitalizing on PyBer's ability to deny any form of wage stability or insurance to the laborers) then a series of "driving shifts" would be a way to rotate drivers from the busy Urban locales while keeping a retainer available to offer the same convenience to the suburban customers. Of course, this requires quite a bit more PyBer-driver relations and responsibilities, but would certainly further PyBer's ability to offer convenient rides at the touch of a button. 


##Analysis - Timing
As seen in the chart below, fares are fairly consistent by city type. That said, there are certain noteworthy spikes in farers for all city types in late February, and a notable rise in fares for rural customers at the beginning of April. Otherwise, it is probably safe to assume that each of these spikes are centered around particular events or holidays.

In order to capitalize on this usage, perhaps next year a promotion should entice new customers during February. Even better, to raise activity in rural cities (say, in March, a particularly slow time for rural climes) a promotion that scales to the distance of the trip. 

Overall, it appears that PyBer's numbers are consistent enough to garner further ridership, and should capitalize on its suburban customers more in order to take money that's left on the table.
